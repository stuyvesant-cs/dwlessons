### More Routines!

- If the door is open, you may enter the room (as long as the previous class period has ended).
- When you come in, take out your notebook, do not log into your computer unless you are told to do so.
- In addition to binary feedback devices, your hands are the best way to let me know you have something important to say, please use them liberally.
- If you need to use the restroom (or leave the room for a moment), use the following ASL sign:
