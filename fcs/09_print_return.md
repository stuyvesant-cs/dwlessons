#### Writing functions in python

Basic syntax
 ```
 def name(input0, input1, ...):
   PYTHON CODE
 ```

 * There is a TAB before each line of code inside the `def` block. It must be a TAB!
 * In order to use a value generated by a function, we must `return` it. This is similar to the `report` keyword in NetLogo.

Example:
```
def c_to_f(celsiusTemp):
  farenheitTemp = celsiusTemp * 9/5 + 32
  return farenheitTemp
```

#### Return vs. Print

`return` is a keyword that will:
- Stop the execution of a function
- provide the value to be used in another function or operation

--

`print()` is a function that will:
- display the provided parameters in the shell when run.

???
# Print vs Return
  * Write a simple function (my_abs or the like)
  * Have it print the result
  * use it in the shell
  * try to assign a variable to it from the shell

  *
