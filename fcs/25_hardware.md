### Processor (CPU)
- Central Processing Unit.
- Performs the basic instructions that programs are broken up into.

--
- Every cycle, the CPU reads in and performs an instruction (as a set of bits).

--
- The speed of a processor is the number of cycles it can run in a second.

--
- Each core is like a separate processor on the same computer chip.

--
- Processors can keep a small amount of data in a _cache_ to help improve performance.

### Storage
- Long term data retention.

--
- Non-volatile: Retains data without needing a power supply.

--
- Example devices:

--
  - SSD, HDD, Flash Drive, DVD…

--

### Memory
- Short term, fast data access.

--
- Only used by what the computer is actively running.

--
- Volatile: Needs electricity to store the data.

--
- Examples: RAM (Random Access Memory), Swap

### Storage & Memory
- All saved data exists in storage.
- Anything that a computer is actively using is in memory.

--
- In order for a computer to use a stored file of any type, the file must be copied from storage into memory (loading).

--
- Saving a file means taking the version currently in memory and writing it back to storage.
