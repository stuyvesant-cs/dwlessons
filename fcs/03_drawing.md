### Do Now (do not log into computers)
#### LEAVE ANY PAPER ON THE COMPUTERS ALONE!

--
1. Half of you have a paper folded over your computer, if you do, you are the describer.
2. If you do not have a paper on your computer, you are the draw-er.
3. __DESCRIBERS DO NOT__ show the paper to your TableBuddy™.
4. __DRAW-ERS DO NOT__ shot your paper to your TableBuddy™.

--
4. Describers must instruct your draw-er to recreate the image in their notebooks without showing them the paper.

???
### Activity Recap
- give 5 min, then have draw-ers hold up their pictures.
- Describers: What did you find difficult?
- Draw-ers: What did you find difficult?

### The Importance of Language

--
Q) What is necessary in order for someone to convey instructions to another person?

--
- An agreed upon basic set of assumptions.

--
- An agreed upon "vocabulary"

--
- Instructions that are clear and follow the agreed upon rules.

--
<hr>

People providing instructions should be able to rely on their instructions being accurately carried out.

--

People following instructions should be able to rely on the instructions being accurate and precise, and following the agreed upon rules.


???
Ask: What would've made this activity easier for you?

### TableBuddy™  Activity.
In a moment, you will take turns instructing each other on how to draw an image. The image will be fairly simple, similar to the do now activity image.

1. Talk to each other and come up with the basic assumptions and vocabulary, write these in your notebook (5 min).

--
2. You each will be given a handout with a  different image, using the agreement from step 1, write a set of instructions that should result in an accurate recreation of the image (2 min).

--
3. The draw-er from the do now will become the describer.
  - Describers: read your instructions to the draw-ers
  - Draw-ers: follow the provided instructions, drawing on the back of your handout.

### Programming Languages

We generate instructions for computers using _programming languages_.

--

In your TableBuddy+™ groups:
1. Ponder & discuss the following questions:
   - What are important features for a programming language to have.
2. Select a representative from your group to report back to the class on your findings.

???
q: b fbk: who has programmed before.
q: what language?
q: why there be so many?

### Computer Science

>>> __Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information.__ Computer science spans theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software). Computer science is generally considered an academic discipline and distinct from computer programming.
