With your TableBuddyâ„¢ write 3 potential test questions.
- The first two should be multiple choice questions with 4 options.
- The second one should be a function to program.
  - This should be similar to the work you have had so far. Include all the information needed to write the function.

Put both questions, and the answers in a markdown file called `test00.rkt`. Both of you need to submit this file. Follow the following formatting.
