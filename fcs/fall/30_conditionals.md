### Conditional Structures
`if`
- `if BOOLEAN [ COMMANDS ]`
- Run `COMMANDS` when `BOOLEAN` is `true`.

--

`ifelse`
```
ifelse BOOLEAN
[ COMMANDS_0 ]
[ COMMANDS_1 ]
```
- Run `COMMANDS_0` when `BOOLEAN` is `true`.
- Run `COMMANDS_1` when `BOOLEAN` is `false`.

General syntax rule:
- `[]` are always used for __code blocks__, commands that are grouped together.
