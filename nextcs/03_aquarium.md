#### Do Now
We will be designing a Fish Tank program that will be a simulation of an aquarium/fish tank. In your TableBuddies+â„¢ groups discuss how you might design this program. Focus on what classes you would need, and how you might use inheritance in some of those classes.

As you are working, create the following diagrams:
- An inheritance tree.
- Class (UML) diagrams, providing fields and methods.
