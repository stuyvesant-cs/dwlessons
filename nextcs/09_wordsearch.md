#### In Your New TableBuddies™ Groups:
- Decide on the next two features that need to be implemented for the wordsearch program (assume you are starting from a completed version of yesterday's assignment).
- List the methods (and/or constants, fields, etc) that you will need in order to implement the two features you decided on. DO NOT concern yourself with things to be added later, your goal is not to complete this program all at once.
- Assign an order to your needed methods, etc, based on what needs to get completed first.
