### Task
- Open a terminal window (protip:  ctrl-alt-t)
- Launch processing from the terminal: `$ processing`.
- Enter the following program into the newly opened processing window:
  ```
  size(400, 200);
  rect(100, 50, 200, 100);
  line(0, 50, 200, 100);
  stroke(0, 255, 255);
  line(200, 100, 399, 50);
  stroke(255, 0, 0);
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  circle(200, 100, 50);
  ```
- Click the play button (triangle), observe the results.
- The program you copied has 6 distinct Processing function calls (2 are repeated). In your notebook, write down each distinct function name, and add notes about how you think the function works.
