### Selection Sort

1. Pick the first value as the current maximum.

--
2. Compare the current maximum to the next value in the list.

--
3. Repeat step 2 until you are at the end of the unsorted section of the list.

--
  - At this point, you will have found the largest remaining value.

--
4. Swap the Last unsorted value with the largest value.

--
3. Start back at the beginning, and repeat steps 1-4.

--
  - The list will get sorted from the back forwards.

--
  - Once the sorted portion of the list is at the beginning of the list, we're done!
