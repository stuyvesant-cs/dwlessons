### Do now:
- Log into your computer and open a terminal (remember how to do that from yesterday?).
- Launch processing from the terminal: `$ processing`.
- Copy the following program:
  ```
  size(400, 200);
  rect(100, 50, 200, 100);
  line(0, 50, 200, 100);
  stroke(0, 255, 255);
  line(200, 100, 399, 50);
  stroke(255, 0, 0);
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  circle(200, 100, 50);
  ```
- Click the play button (triangle), observe the results.
- The program you copied has 6 distinct Processing function calls (2 are repeated). In your notebook, write down each distinct function name, and add notes about how you think the function works.

### TableTalk™
- With your TableBuddy™, discuss the function calls, share how you think they work.
- At this point, change some of the arguments, test if your hypotheses are correct.
- Make note of any lingering questions you have.

--
- With your TableBuddies+™, share your lingering questions, see if you can answer them.

Important things to note:
__I will not only have important information on slides TAKE NOTES__
- Size and geometry of screen.
- Order of commands matters.
- `stroke` and `fill`. (`noStroke` and `noFill`)
- color input, RGB, graysccale, hex, - Color Selector tool
- Saving a processing program. Where'd it go?
