### Sorting!

* Each group will be given a set of shuffled cards.

* The goal of each group is to produce a sorted set of cards (2-10,J,Q,K,A).

* At least one person in the group should write down the steps taken to create the sorted set of cards.

* Each group should end up with an algorithm based off of the steps they took to sort their cards.

* The goal is to have an algorithm that anyone could follow to create a sorted set of cards from a shuffled one.
