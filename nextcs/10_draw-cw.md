### Skills Based Grading
We have identified 20 _skills_ that are the key components of this course. Your grade will be based directly on your ability to demonstrate mastery of those skills.

--
- Each individual skill will be graded on a scale of 1 (minimal competency) to 4 (mastery).

--
- Each skill will be evaluated throughout the year on assessments (exams, labs, projects).

--
- Students will be given multiple opportunities to demonstrate their skill abilities.

--
- Homework, Classwork and any other non-assessment assignments will not be graded.

### Skills Based Grading: Assessments
a.k.a. Points don't exist

--
- Assessments (tests, labs, projects) will _not_ be given grades out of 100 (or some other percentage).

--
- Each assessment will evaluate a subset of skills. Each skill assessed will be given a 1-4 grade.

--
- Once graded, each assessment will have separate grades for each skill.
  - e.g. If Test 0 covered skills 1, 2, 5, and 10, then when returned you will see four grades at the top of the exam, one for each skill.

--
- For labs and projects, rubrics will be provided detailing how to demonstrate mastery for each skill specific to that assignment.

### Late Assignments & Retakes

- Non-assessments are not counted in your grade, so latness on them will not have a grade impact.

--
- If you are absent for an exam, you may take a make-up provided you have an excused absence note.
  - Re-takes must be done outside of class time, as soon as possible after you return to school.

--
- Labs and projects will always have an assigned due date. If you have a demonstrated resaon, late submissions will be accepted, within reason, but after a certain point late work will not be accepted for a given assignment.

--
- Since skills will be evaluated mutlipe times over the course of the semester, there will not be retaces or resubmissions.

### Grade Caluculations
a.k.a. Points don't exist, really

- At the end of the semester, you will have multiple grades for each skill.

--
- In additon, there will be a final exam and/or project that will cover all the skills.

--
- Your grade for each skill
