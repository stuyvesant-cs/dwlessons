### Do Now

- Write a function `lineY(float x, float m, float b)` that returns the y value for the line determined by the provided x value and the equation:

$$ y = mx + b $$

- Write a function `parabolaY(float x, float a, float b, float c)` that returns the y value for the parabola determined by the provided x value and the equation:

$$ y = ax^2 + bx + c $$

- Write a `draw` function to test these two functions. Pass in the current frame as the x value for both functions. Draw a circle at the x, y coordinates created for each. Write a `setup` and any other variables as needed.
