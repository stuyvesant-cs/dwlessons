### Measuring Digital Data
All digital data is (eventually) stored and transmitted as binary values.
- __bit__: A unit of measurment that equals a single BInary digiT (or Binary digIT).
  - A bit is the smallest amount of information possible in computing.

--
- __byte__: 8 bits

--
- __b__ is used to dennote bits while __B__ is used to dennote bytes

### Measuring Digital Data

We use bits and bytes most often to measure two kinds fo things:

--
- Size

--
  - How large/small is a file?
  - How much data can fit on a hard drive?
  - How much data can fit in RAM?


--
- Speed

--
  - How fast is the network speed?
  - How fast can data transfer form a hard drive to memory?
