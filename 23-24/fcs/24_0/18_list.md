### Do Now
On Friday you worked on an assignment built on a game with the following rules:
- A player rolls a 10 sided die as many times as they like.
- If a player rolls an even number of times, their score is the sum of all even values rolled.
- If a player rolls an odd number of times, their score is the sum of all the odd values rolled.
- If a player rolls an even number of times, but gets a 1 or 2, their score is 0.
- If a player rolls an odd number of times, but gets a 1, their score is 0.

Consider the following questions with your TableBuddyâ„¢:
- If you were going to play the game, would you roll an even or odd number of times?
- How could you determine if this game was fair?
- What values could we change about this game that could potentially impact the overall "fairness" of the game?
