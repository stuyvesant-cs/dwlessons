#### Do Now (log into computers)
1. Access your homework from yesterday.
2. Share your solutions with your TableBuddyâ„¢
3. Discuss: What changes you needed to make to account for `mass`.
4. Discuss: How would you use the `getGravity()` method to simulate the gravity objects on earth feel?

#### Do More:
1. Create a subclass of `Orb` called `FixedOrb`.
   - `FixedOrb` objects should work like orbs, except they never move.
   - `FixedOrb` should be as small as possible.
2. Create an `earth` `FixedOrb` variable, use it to create a more accurate earth gravity simulation.
