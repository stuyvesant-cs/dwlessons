### Do Now

- Write a function `plotLine(int x, float m, float b, int csize)` that draws a circle of `csize` diameter at `(x, y)` determined by the point-slope equation of a line:

$$ y = mx + b$$

- Write a function `plotParabola(int x, float a, float b, float c int csize)` that draws a circle of `csize` diameter at `(x, y)` determined by:

$$ y = ax^2 + bx + c$$

- Write a `draw` function to test these two functions. Pass in the current frame as the x value for both functions. Write a `setup` and any other variables as needed.
