### Working With Boolean Values
- In Java `true` and `false` are the literal boolean values.
- Comparison operators:
  - `>` , `<`, `<=`, `>=`
  - `==`: Equality test.
  - `!=`: Inequality test.

--
- Boolean operators:
  - `&&`: and
  - `||`: or (this is the _pipe_, shift-\\)
  - `!`: not

### While Loops
- Java has `while` and `for` loops.
- Syntax:
  ```
  while ( BOOLEAN ) {
    CODE
  }
  ```
- `CODE` will repeat as long as `BOOLEAN` is true.
